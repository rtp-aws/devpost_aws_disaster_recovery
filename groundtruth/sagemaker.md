# sage maker ground truth

I've created  a few labeling jobs, teams, done some labeling etc.  This
is the notes taken during the label task of C3 for bounding boxes.

# Things to note about labeling

If camera angle is such that bounding box can be perpendicular to seam, it would
be excellent.  Its one bounding box instead of multiple.

# C3

Used multiple camera locations.  Labeling and model performance was dismal.

# C4

Focus on a single bridge.  The goal is to identify the bridge seam.
