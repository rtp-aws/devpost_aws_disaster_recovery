TODO: These need to point to the other things

The best way to ensure permissions are correct is to sign in to the console, create a sample elastic beanstalk app.
With that said, I did create some intial persmissions for the devpost-xxx user and document it elsewhere.  Here are
the mods I added when I created a sample app.



### preq setup pyenv
[pyenv setup](pyenv.md)

### install and use eb cli
[eb install and use](eb_cli.md)


### local execution

```
make runlocal
```

open browser to 

```
http://localhost:8080/
```
