# Makefile notes


A Makefile is of this form

```
some-target: some-dependicies
  some-rule
```

When a target is older than its corresponding dependency, the rule is executed.

For example:

```
foo.exe: foo.c
  gcc foo.c -o foo.exe
```


## := vs =

These are rules for assigning variables which can be used to make the
makefile more concise

taken from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10227598/what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-make-file)

* `:=` is expanded once
* `=` is expanded each time its used

## special variables 

taken from [this](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables)

* `$<` is known as first prereq - i call them dependencies
* `$?` is known as all prereq newer than target - ditto
* `$@` is known as target filename.

```
goo:
loo:
foo:goo loo
	echo "first prereq "$<
	echo "all prereqs "$?
	echo "the target" $@
```

and using make -s to avoid echo of commands. silent mode.

```
$ make -s foo
first prereq goo
all prereqs goo loo
the target foo
```

`.PHONY` is for targets which you want to be built every time the makefile runs, regardless of whether it exists or not or is out of date. â€“
