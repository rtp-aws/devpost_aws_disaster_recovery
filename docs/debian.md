# Debian notes

Adding a debian notes section to track down why the two linux laptops
fail to use pyenv the same.  Taken from my private gitlab.com notes.

On zatoichi, it works correctly.

```
. ./setenv.sh
python --versions
works good
```


# Redirect output for pagers and logging

```
Redirect stderr to stdout
2>&1
Capture both stderr and stdout to a file
command &> foo.log
```




# Which packages are installed?

```
apt list --installed
or
dpkg-query -l
or
dpkg --get-selections
```

# Which binaries are installed by a particular package?
```
dpkg -L eterm | grep bin
```

# what is version of an installed package?
```
dpkg -s eterm
```

# prompt modifications

```
# set variable identifying the chroot you work in (used in the prompt below)
if [ -z "${debian_chroot:-}" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then
    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)

        # (ISO/IEC-6429). (Lack of such support is extremely rare, and such
        # a case would tend to support setf rather than setaf.)
